Project Overview
The goal of this project is to visualize sales data to help a car dealership or manufacturer monitor their Year-to-Date (YTD) performance. The dashboard is split into two primary views:

Overview Panel: High-level summary of sales trends, regional performance, and product distributions.

Details Panel: A granular look at individual transactions for deep-dive auditing.

📈 Key Metrics (KPIs)
The dashboard tracks three primary KPIs:

YTD Total Sales: $371.19M (representing a 23.59% growth).

YTD Average Price: $28.0K per vehicle.

YTD Total Units Sold: 13K cars (up 24.57% vs previous period).
